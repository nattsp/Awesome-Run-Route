My friend and I follow this awesome run in Melbourne, Australia. This route would be equally good as a bike ride. The trail is mainly off road on walking and cycling tracks.

See the map for major path changes, coffee stops and sights to explore.

These directions are set up anticlockwise but could equally be done the other way.
